This project aims to experiment with various methods to present a data feed which is essentially an index and make it searchable for convenience. The specific domain is DnD 5e rules which do not have a good service to search the rule contents.

# Initial prototype

* Annotate a list of several definitions using schema.org annotations
* Use a custom Google Search to index and search contents
