<h1>Percentile dice</h1>
<p>Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently than normal dice. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the ten digits, and the other gives the ones digit. Two 0s represent 100.</p>
