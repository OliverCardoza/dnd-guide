<h1>Abilities</h1>
<p>Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdon, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. These ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character's or monster's behalf.</p>
